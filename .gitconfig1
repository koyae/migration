	# Git can get majorly stuck if you are too far behind and you try to do a
	# rebasing pull, such that it will be unable to pick all the commits you
	# would need to catch back up. So by default, simply make a merge-commit
	# when pulling from another (remote) branch into local, rather than trying
	# to replay current changes over top of whatever was just pulled in:
	rebase = false
	# ^ Note that you can usually just `git rebase` (by itself) to eliminate
	# the extra merge-commit that will appear in your commit-history when you
	# `git pull [<remote> <branchName>]` and you're behind.  Alternatively, you
	# can `git pull --rebase [<source>]` if you know you're in a spot where you
	# really want to. Note that the above command is equivalent to always just
	# doing `git pull --no-rebase [<source>]`
